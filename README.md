# JARLA
Just Another Reinforcement Learning Agent. Jarla's purpose is to be a digital "pet" of sorts. Let's see how this goes. Can we teach it tricks by giving it treats?

It's a small robot that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and uses Keras on Tensorflow and a cheap Raspberry Pi Camera. This project very well may not work as desired at all. Even if it totally fails, though, I'll learn and be left with a nice little robotic platform to run future projects on.
